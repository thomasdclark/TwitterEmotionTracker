#TwitterEmotionTracker
A fork of [TwitterSmileTracker](https://github.com/thomasdclark/TwitterSmileTracker) to add additional functionality, while still maintaining TwitterSmileTracker.

##Intended Additional Functionality
* Add additional emotions rather than just happy and sad
* Graph the amount of smiley faces and frowny faces over time
* Save data after analysis rather than discarding it
* Improve the GUI
